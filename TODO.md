# PriceLance – Core TODOs

## Must-have before broad public launch
- Tighten or enable Supabase Row Level Security for user-facing data.
- Add basic analytics/metrics (search volume, top queries).
- Review and clean up ESLint errors that matter (not just stylistic ones).

## Nice-to-have after launch
- Expand product categories (e.g., tablets, smartwatches, headphones, monitors, peripherals).
- Improve Assistant logic to surface more nuanced advice (e.g., best value vs. absolute cheapest).
- Implement a simple favorites system hooked to real user auth (when you add auth).
- Add a safe, rate-limited discovery mode using an external provider.
